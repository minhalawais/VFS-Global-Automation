Project README: VFS Global Appointment Automation

Overview:
This project is designed to automate the appointment booking process for VFS Global services. It utilizes Selenium, a web testing library, to interact with the VFS Global website, navigate through the pages, and book appointments for users.

Project Structure:
Dependencies:
Selenium: A powerful tool for controlling a web browser through the program.
threading: Python module to perform tasks concurrently using threads.
File Structure:
vfs_appointment_automation.py: The main script containing functions for login, page navigation, and appointment booking.
How to Use:
Dependencies Installation:

Install Selenium and other required packages using the following:
bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
Web Driver:

This script uses the Chrome web driver. Ensure that you have the correct version of the ChromeDriver executable for your Chrome browser installed and provide the path to it in the script.
User Data Configuration:

Edit the data list to include the user information for whom you want to automate the appointment booking. Each user is represented by a dictionary containing details such as reference number, email, city, and desired appointment date(s).
Execution:

Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
The script will initiate multiple threads, each handling a user's appointment booking process concurrently.
Additional Notes:
Error Handling:

The script includes error-handling mechanisms, such as retrying in case of failures and closing the browser gracefully.
Threading:

Multiple threads are used to handle appointment booking for different users simultaneously, improving efficiency.
Important Considerations:

Ensure compliance with VFS Global's terms of service and guidelines while using this script.
Adjustments may be needed based on changes to the VFS Global website structure.
Disclaimer:
This script is for educational purposes and should be used responsibly. It is not intended for any malicious activities or violation of terms of service. Use it at your own risk, and respect the policies of the website being automated.
